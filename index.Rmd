# Welcome {-}

Welcome to the website of the WIPO patent landscape report on marine genetic resources for ten Southeast Asian countries. This is the electronic version of the 2019 [WIPO Patent Landscape Report: Marine Genetic Resources](https://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/wipo_pub_947_6.
pdf).

The WIPO Report on the Scientific and Patent Landscape for Marine Genetic Resources in Southeast Asia, was written with the generous financial support of the Patent Office of Japan (JPO). 

The report is based on data from a combination of Clarivate Analytics Web of Science Core Collection, Clarivate Analytics Derwent Innovation patent collections and the EPO World Patent Statistical Database (PATSTAT, October 2016 edition, IISC edition). The report is made possible by the increasing availability of digital information on biodiversity and the development of tools to access this data. We thank the [World Register of Marine Species](http://www.marinespecies.org/) which made available the list of marine species used in this research, and the [Global Names Index](http://gni.globalnames.org/) for data on variations in species names. Environmental information on marine species for the WoRMS database was available thanks to the API made available by [Lifewatch Belgium](http://www.lifewatch.be/data-services/?cache=1521050271). Additional taxonomic information and species occurrence data was obtained from the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)](https://www.gbif.org/). The GBIF API was accessed using the [ROpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) R package `rgbif` and the resolution of taxonomic names was performed using the ROpenSci `taxize` package [@R-rgbif; @R-taxize]. Name cleaning, text mining and author and inventor analysis was performed using VantagePoint from Search Technology Inc and additional text mining was performed in R using the tidytext package [@R-tidytext]. General data analysis was performed in the R programming language in RStudio using tidyverse packages [@R-base; @R-tidyverse]. The report was written in R markdown with Bookdown [@R-rmarkdown; @R-bookdown].

The report was written by Dr. Paul Oldham (Senior Adjunct Fellow at the United Nations University Institute for the Advanced Study of Sustainability and Industrial Fellow at the Manchester Institute of Innovation Research, Alliance Manchester Business School, University of Manchester). Ms. Nicola Shale served as the ecologist for the project and Ms. Jasmine Kindness as Research Assistant. The report was prepared under the coordination of and with contributions by Ms. Irene Kitsara (WIPO).
